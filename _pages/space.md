I'm a big fan of space. I'm a founder of Manchester Space Programme, which aims to increase awareness of space for the local community but doing cool stuff. We have launched high altitude balloons and rockets with varying payloadsand started a project to get into schools with custom kits to launch your own ballons.

Recently been following spacex and their forays to orbit and back. I have presented to different groups around manchester and attended the national space conference.

Now on the lookout for our next big space adventure.
